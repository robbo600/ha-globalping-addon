api_token: ""              # Optional: Your Globalping API token for increased limits
adoption_token: ""         # Optional: GP_ADOPTION_TOKEN for probe registration
default_location: "world"  # Default location for tests (world, europe, asia, etc.)
web_interface: true        # Enable the web interface on port 8080
log_level: "info"         # Log level (debug, info, warn, error)
```

Examples:
- `world` - Use probes from around the world
- `europe` - Use probes from Europe
- `us-east` - Use probes from US East Coast
- `germany` - Use probes from Germany
- `google` - Use probes hosted on Google Cloud

#### Option: `web_interface`

Enable or disable the web interface accessible on port 8080.

#### Option: `log_level`

Set the logging level for the add-on.

## Usage

### Web Interface

After starting the add-on, access the web interface at:
`http://homeassistant.local:8080`

The interface allows you to:
- Select test type (ping, traceroute, DNS, HTTP)
- Enter target hostname or URL
- Choose location
- View real-time results

### Home Assistant Services (Coming Soon)

*Note: Home Assistant service integration is planned for a future update. Currently, you can use the web interface for testing.*

The add-on will provide several services for use in automations:

#### Service: `globalping.ping` (Future)

```yaml
service: globalping.ping
data:
  target: "google.com"
  location: "europe"
  count: 4
```

#### Service: `globalping.traceroute` (Future)

```yaml
service: globalping.traceroute
data:
  target: "cloudflare.com"
  location: "us-west"
```

#### Service: `globalping.dns_lookup` (Future)

```yaml
service: globalping.dns_lookup
data:
  target: "example.com"
  location: "asia"
  record_type: "A"
```

#### Service: `globalping.http_test` (Future)

```yaml
service: globalping.http_test
data:
  target: "https://mywebsite.com"
  location: "north-america"
```

### Automation Examples (Future)

*These examples will work once Home Assistant service integration is implemented.*

#### Monitor Website Availability

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Global Website Health Check"
    trigger:
      - platform: time_pattern
        minutes: "/30"  # Every 30 minutes
    action:
      - service: globalping.ping
        data:
          target: "mywebsite.com"
          location: "europe,asia,north-america"
        response_variable: results
      - condition: template
        value_template: "{{ 'failed' in results.status }}"
      - service: notify.pushbullet
        data:
          message: "Website connectivity issues detected!"
```

#### DNS Monitoring

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Monitor DNS Resolution"
    trigger:
      - platform: time_pattern
        hours: "/6"  # Every 6 hours
    action:
      - service: globalping.dns_lookup
        data:
